On Tuesday, the 167-year old Swiss bank faced investors for the first time since the deal was struck and for the last time as an independent firm. Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"". But one investor told the bank that shareholders had ""everything stolen from them"". Credit Suisse was rescued by UBS last month in a deal brokered by authorities after turmoil in the US banking sector sent the Swiss lender's shares tumbling.The loss-making bank had already been struggling for a number of years after a series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets.Mr Lehmann told investors at the Annual General Meeting that management had a plan to turn things around but had been ""thwarted"" by fears prompted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US. But one shareholder suggested the board would have been crucified in medieval times.Another held up a sack of empty walnut shells, saying they cost the same as a single Credit Suisse share.Credit Suisse's chief executive Ulrich Korner said: ""I understand that you feel disappointed, shocked, or angry.""I share the disappointment of you, our shareholders, but I also share the disappointment of all of our employees, our clients and, ultimately, the general public.""Swiss probe into UBS takeover of Credit SuisseCredit Suisse crisis is a blow to Swiss stabilityShareholders in both Credit Suisse and UBS - which will hold an investor meeting on Wednesday - have been denied a vote on the takeover because of the emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through.Mr Lehmann said the only other option would have been bankruptcy.""This would have led to the worst scenario, namely a total loss for shareholders, unpredictable risks for clients, severe consequences for the economy and the global financial markets,"" he said. ""It was our duty to protect the interests of our shareholders as best we could to provide security to our clients. We did everything we could within what was possible.""Analysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC Geneva correspondentCredit Suisse bosses knew they would have to eat humble pie at this meeting, but despite numerous apologies the shareholders remain angry. It's common for middle-class Swiss people, especially the elderly, to invest money in a few shares as a back-up to their pensions. What have they traditionally considered safe? Switzerland's two biggest banks. But now Credit Suisse shares are worth less than 10% of what they were two years ago. One man representing a group of shareholders accused Credit Suisse management of ""greed and incompetence"", another pointed to his red tie, saying he was wearing it to represent the ""red card"" Credit Suisse deserved. Others turned their anger on the Swiss government, which forced through the takeover by UBS over just one weekend while the markets were closed. Some of us, said one shareholder, spend more time choosing our smartphones. Venting their anger is just about the only action the shareholders can take; the deal with UBS is done. Apologising again, CEO Ulrich Korner said there had been little choice, it was either take the deal with UBS or bankruptcy, which he said would have been catastrophic not just for Switzerland, but for the entire global economy.Related TopicsUBSBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storySwiss probe into UBS takeover of Credit Suisse2 AprilCredit Suisse crisis is a blow to Swiss stability19 MarchTop StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

At the time, the Swiss National Bank said the deal was the best way to restore the confidence of financial markets and to manage risks to the economy. The takeover came as markets were being rattled by fears over the health of the global financial system following the failures of two smaller US banks.The deal, when it was announced, valued Credit Suisse at $3.15bn (£2.6bn), whereas on the Friday before the settlement was reached it had been valued at about $8bn.However, the deal has angered taxpayers and shareholders of both banks, who were deprived of a vote on the takeover. Some have also argued it has damaged Switzerland's global reputation as a financial centre.In statement issued on Sunday, Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor said there were ""numerous aspects of events around Credit Suisse"" that need to be investigated to identify any possible ""criminal offences"".""The Office of the Attorney General wants to proactively fulfil its mandate and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial centre and has set up a monitoring system so that it can take action immediately on any issues that fall within its area of responsibility,"" it added.It added it had made contact with ""national and cantonal authorities"", and that ""investigative orders were also issued"".Separately, Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported on Sunday that the newly combined UBS-Credit Suisse bank was set to cut its workforce by 20-30%.The combined bank will have more than 120,000 staff worldwide. The report said about 11,000 jobs could be cut in Switzerland.Related TopicsCompaniesUBSBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storyUK banking system 'safe' after Credit Suisse rescue20 MarchTop StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

However the FT said terms could change and a deal had not yet been reached.Image source, EPAImage caption, Senior figures from UBS were seen heading to the Swiss government's finance department on SundayUBS shareholders would normally have six weeks to consider a deal on this scale, but the FT says the Swiss authorities are planning to change the country's laws to bypass a shareholder vote on the transaction.Bank of England officials have confirmed they are in close contact with their counterparts at the Swiss National Bank while regulators and management discuss Credit Suisse's future. The UK Treasury is also monitoring the situation.Is this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?The deal would amount to a significant intervention from the Swiss authorities, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to German financial services firm Allianz.""This is not a voluntary action, this is a shotgun wedding and it's being done in order to restore financial stability,"" Mr El-Erian told the BBC. ""Without it Credit Suisse may end up in a death spiral, in which it finds it much harder to undertake its banking activities.""That could raise questions about other banks at a time when there are also banking concerns in the United States.""Mr El-Erian said the current turmoil could lead to banks becoming more ""risk averse"", leading to a fall in credit availability. But that amounted to a ""headwind"" for the global economy, rather than something like the sudden stop experienced during the 2008 financial crisis, which was ""in a completely different league"" to today's problems, he said.UBS is said to have asked the Swiss government to cover about $6bn (£4.9bn) in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse, according to sources quoted by Reuters.  Credit Suisse reported a loss of 7.3bn Swiss francs ($7.9bn; £6.5bn) in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024.UBS, however, made a profit of $7.6bn in 2022.Any deal may also result in significant job losses. As well as being a domestic bank with 95 branches, Credit Suisse has a global investment banking operation and manages the assets of rich clients. At the end of last year Credit Suisse had a global staff of 50,480, including 16,700 in Switzerland, though 9,000 jobs were to be axed, the Swiss broadcaster SRF reports.Related TopicsBankingCredit SuisseSwitzerlandMore on this storyCredit Suisse to borrow $54bn to shore up finances16 MarchMulti-billion dollar rescue deal for US bank16 MarchIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?21 MarchCredit Suisse cuts 9,000 jobs to stem losses27 October 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

Founded in 1856, the bank has been a pillar of the Swiss financial sector ever since. Although buffeted by the financial crisis of 2008, Credit Suisse did manage to weather that storm without a government bailout, unlike its rival-turned-rescuer UBS.More recently, the marketing face of Credit Suisse has been Switzerland's tennis god Roger Federer. He smiles down from posters at Swiss airports, a symbol of strength, excellence, staying power and reliability.But behind the glossy promotion were some big problems. Divisive management, costly exposure to finance company Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, a seedy money laundering case, and waning customer confidence in the last few months, which saw billions being withdrawn from the bank.All it took to turn those doubts into a stampede was an apparently off the cuff remark from the Saudi National Bank, which owns almost 10% of Credit Suisse, suggesting it would not be increasing its investment.Credit Suisse's shares went into free fall, and even a statement of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, and an offer of $50bn (£41bn) in financial support, couldn't stabilise the situation.Asleep at the wheel?How could this have happened?After the financial crisis 15 years ago Switzerland introduced strict so-called ""too big to fail"" laws for its biggest banks. Never again, went the thinking, should the Swiss taxpayer have to bail out a Swiss bank, as happened with UBS.But Credit Suisse is a ""too big to fail"" bank. In theory, it had the capital to prevent this week's catastrophe.Also in theory Swiss financial regulators and the Swiss National Bank keep an eye on those systemically important banks and can intervene before disaster strikes.It was odd, last week, to see the rest of the world reacting with real concern as Credit Suisse shares tumbled, and to hear, at first, nothing from Switzerland.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Roger Federer went from winning prize money sponsored by Credit Suisse, to being its marketing figureheadEven the Swiss media seemed not to notice the headlines over at the Financial Times, and seemed more interested in the continued debate over how much support neutral Switzerland should be offering to Ukraine.By the time people did notice, such damage had been done that Credit Suisse was beyond saving. The fallout had begun to threaten not just Switzerland's entire financial sector, but Europe's.As the government met in emergency session to try to find a solution, you could almost smell the panic in Bern.Announcing the bank takeover, Swiss President Alain Berset said ""an uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system"".It's hard to avoid the conclusion, some Swiss are now saying, that the very people who should have acted to prevent Credit Suisse's meltdown were asleep at the wheel.Switzerland's reputation damagedThat lack of attention is going to be very costly. UBS's takeover, for the paltry sum of $3bn (£2.5bn), besides being an utter humiliation for Credit Suisse, is likely to leave its shareholders a good bit poorer.There will also be job losses, perhaps in the thousands. There are Credit Suisse and UBS branches in just about every Swiss town. Once the takeover is complete, there will be little point in UBS keeping them all open.But perhaps the most costly damage of all could be to Switzerland's reputation as a safe place to invest. Despite the scandals over the years related to the secret bank accounts of dictators (including Ferdinand Marcos from the Philippines, Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and many more), or the money laundering for drug lords and tax evaders, Swiss banks hung on to that reputation symbolised by Roger Federer: strong, and reliable.But now? A system that allows a 167-year-old bank to go belly up, in the space of a few days, at the cost of many jobs and massive losses in share value? That could cause huge reputational damage. The Swiss banking sector, Switzerland's financial regulators, and its government, all say the takeover is the best solution.In the end, at the very last minute, it was the only solution. In the coming days, there will be some tough questions to answer.Related TopicsUBSBankingCredit SuisseSwitzerlandMore on this storyUK banking system 'safe' after Credit Suisse rescue20 MarchCredit Suisse guilty over money-laundering charges27 June 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

British banks, which last week saw their steepest falls in more than a year, also remained in the red. However, experts are not forecasting a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis when the failure of a number of big banks sparked a global recession. The Swiss National Bank said the rescue deal for Credit Suisse was the best way to restore the confidence of financial markets and to manage risks to the economy.Is this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?Central banks to boost flow of US dollarsThe last-minute deal valued Credit Suisse at just over $3.15bn (£2.6bn), a fraction of its $8bn price tag on Friday.But the sale has achieved what regulators set out to do - secure a result before the financial markets opened on Monday. Mark Yallop, the former UK chief executive of UBS, said the his former employer's purchase of Credit Suisse ""should"" do the job of reassuring investors.""This is a takeover of a challenged institution with particular idiosyncratic problems that relate to it specifically [and are] not reflective of broader issues in the banking markets,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.""I think this transaction will definitely stabilise [the bank] and should bring a good degree of confidence back to the banking market more generally.""Mr Yallop suggested the sale of Credit Suisse should be viewed as a separate event to failure of two smaller banks in the US, which he said had been hit by the impact of rising interest rates.In a bid to keep cash available through the global financial system, six central banks, including the Bank of England, also announced they would boost the flow of US dollars through the global financial system.The Bank of England, along with the Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank, said the move served as an ""important backstop to ease strains in global funding markets"" and take the pressure off banks.Image source, EPAImage caption, The chairmen of both banks spoke at a news conference in Bern on SundayIn a statement following UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's central bank said the deal protected the Swiss economy ""in this exceptional situation"".The 167-year-old bank is loss-making and has faced a string of problems in recent years, including money laundering charges.It was given an emergency $54bn lifeline from the Swiss National Bank on Wednesday in a bid to reassure markets, but Credit Suisse shares tumbled 24%, meaning a rescue deal was needed.Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern after Sunday night's announcement, UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said the takeover had been ""attractive"" for UBS shareholders, but described it as ""an emergency rescue"".Mr Kelleher said UBS would be winding down the investment banking part of Credit Suisse.The UBS chairman said it was ""too early"" to say what would happen about jobs. Credit Suisse has around 74,000 staff, around 5,000 of them in the UK.  ""We need to do this in a rational way thoughtfully, when we've sat down and analysed what we need to do,"" he said.Other global financial institutions praised the deal. The Bank of England said it welcomed the ""comprehensive set of actions"" set out by the Swiss authorities. ""We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today's announcements and will continue to support their implementation.""It added the UK banking system was ""well capitalised and funded, and remains safe and sound"".Image source, Getty ImagesChristine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said she welcomed the ""swift action"" of the Swiss authorities.""The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions,"" Ms Lagarde added.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell both said the US banking system remained ""resilient"".Credit Suisse has become the latest and most important casualty of a crisis of confidence that has already seen the failure of two mid-sized US banks and an emergency industry whip-round for another. But this is different. Switzerland's second biggest lender was considered one of the top 30 most important banks in the world - which is why this takeover was rushed through by the Swiss authorities. Although the reasons for each failure differ slightly, the main factor has been a sharp rise in global interest rates which has hit the value of even safe investments that banks keep some of their money in. That has spooked investors and seen the share prices of all banks fall with those considered weakest hit hardest.  The financial authorities in the EU, US and UK are saying they support this deal, stressing that banks are strong and people's savings and deposits are safe. The acid test as to whether this Swiss rescue has calmed nerves in the financial world will be when financial markets open on Monday - which is why it was so important to get this done on Sunday night.Related TopicsUBSBankingCredit SuisseSwitzerlandMore on this storyCredit Suisse to borrow $54bn to shore up finances16 MarchMulti-billion dollar rescue deal for US bank16 MarchCredit Suisse cuts 9,000 jobs to stem losses27 October 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

It lost money in 2021 and again in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024. Shares in the firm had already been severely hit before this week - their value falling by roughly two-thirds last year - as customers pulled funds.The bank's disclosure on Tuesday of ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting controls renewed investor concerns.These were intensified when the chairman of the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, said it would not buy more shares in the Swiss bank on regulatory grounds.At that time, Credit Suisse insisted its financial position was not a concern. But shares in the lender ended Wednesday down 24%, as other banks rushed to reduce their exposure to the firm and prime ministers in Spain and France spoke out in an attempt to ease fears.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A bank run on Silicon Valley Bank ended in its collapse last weekThis comes after Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down on Friday by US regulators in what was the largest failure of a US bank since 2008. SVB's UK arm was snapped up for £1 by HSBC. In the wake of the SVB collapse, New York-based Signature Bank also went bust, with the US regulators guaranteeing all deposits at both. However, fears have persisted that other banks could face similar troubles, and trading in bank shares has been volatile this week.The Stoxx Europe banking share index tumbled 7% on Wednesday.In the US, shares in both small and large banks were hit, helping to push the Dow down almost 0.9%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7%.The UK's FTSE 100 fell by 3.8% or 293 points - the biggest one-day drop since the early days of the pandemic in 2020. ""This banking crisis came from America. And now people are watching how the whole thing could also cause problems in Europe,"" said Robert Halver, head of capital markets at Germany's Baader Bank.""If a bank has had even the remotest problem in the past, if major investors say we don't want to invest any more and don't want to let new money flow into this bank, then of course a story is being told where many investors say we want to get out.""Related TopicsCompaniesStock marketsBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storyWarning that US banks face more pain14 MarchIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?21 MarchTop StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes were also down.Credit Suisse had rattled investors earlier this week when it admitted that it had found ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting, while its biggest shareholder - the Saudi National Bank - said it could not inject further funds into the Swiss lender.The firm, which has been troubled for a long time and continues to be loss-making, received an emergency £45bn lifeline from the Swiss National Bank, but fears about the bank's health remain.Roughly $466m has left Credit Suisse's European and US managed funds in recent days, according to data from financial services firm Morningstar.Morningstar analysts Niklas Kammer and Johann Scholtz said they believed the problems at Credit Suisse were ""idiosyncratic in nature and we believe containable for now even in a worst-case scenario"".However, they added that ""developments are currently happening at a rapid pace and views we form today may be stale tomorrow"".The issues at Credit Suisse - which employs about 50,000 people worldwide, with around 5,000 in London - have coincided with the failure of two lenders in the US - Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank - raising fears over the health of the banking system.US regulators stepped in at the weekend to ensure that customers at SVB and Signature Bank had full access to their money - in an effort to head off further panic.But concerns remain that other banks, including San Francisco-based First Republic, could be vulnerable to a rush of customers withdrawing their deposits. It shares had sunk by nearly 70% over the last week.The 11 US banks who announced support for First Republic on Thursday said the action reflected their ""confidence in the country's banking system"".US financial officials said the move was ""most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system"".  Image source, Getty ImagesCentral banks around the world have sharply raised borrowing costs over the past year to try to curb the pace of overall price rises, or inflation. The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower, a change that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about whether other firms are facing similar situation.On Friday, SVB Financial Group - the parent group for Silicon Valley Bank - filed for bankruptcy protection to enable it to sell off its remaining assets.Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at US asset manager Payden and Regal, said other banks could be caught up in the problem.""There could be other vulnerabilities... if central banks are intent on continuing to raise interest rates,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.""Historically when that happens we do see fragility, we do see problems in the financial system.""Before the turbulence in the banking sector erupted, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates further at meetings next week. However, due to recent events, some have speculated these rate rises might be scaled back or even scrapped.On Thursday, the ECB announced a further increase to interest rates from 2.5% to 3%.Related TopicsCompaniesStock marketsBankingMore on this storyMulti-billion dollar rescue deal for US bank16 MarchCredit Suisse to borrow $54bn to shore up finances16 MarchIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?21 MarchWarning that US banks face more pain14 MarchView commentsTop StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

The economist Nouriel Roubini, nicknamed ""Dr Doom"" for his usually pessimistic and sometimes correct predictions, argues Credit Suisse could be a Lehmans moment - too big to fail, too big to save, he told Bloomberg.Larry Fink, the founder of the world's biggest asset manager, Blackrock, said we may be in for ""slow rolling crisis"" which could see hundreds of small banks go bust, like the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, when more than 1,000 smaller US lenders went under.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nouriel Roubini has been nicknamed ""Dr Doom"" but his warnings carry weightBut Noel Quinn, chief executive of HSBC, which is the new owner of Silicon Valley Bank UK, disagreed. He said the authorities - in this case the UK Treasury and the Bank of England - had acted swiftly to find a solution as did their US counterparts in taking over the US parent bank.It's clear that international regulators have learned from the last crisis that speed is of the essence, which is just as well. Technology bosses in the US admitted they had debated in online chats whether to take deposits out of Silicon Valley Bank. When some did, they all did within a matter of minutes, thanks to the social media grapevine, effectively breaking the bank. If nothing else, these outbreaks of instability make it clear that when you reverse nearly 15 years of close-to-zero interest rates suddenly things can and do break. The weakest organisations are the most at risk, and both depositors and investors are perfectly rational in being extremely jittery. More questions remain around the other big teaching points from the last crisis: whether it's ok to assume the central bank ambulance will always arrive in time, and whether that assumption has made people too relaxed in the face of lurking financial danger.Related TopicsCompaniesHSBCBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storyIs London's stock market losing its lustre?3 MarchBuilding giant chooses US over London in blow to UK2 MarchBank rules in biggest shake-up in over 30 years9 December 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

After scandals in recent years and a SF4bn ($4bn, £3.5bn) loss in the most recent quarter, the bank said it was taking ""a series of decisive actions"".It said 9,000 posts would go over the next three years but did not say where the cuts would fall.Chairman Axel Lehmann dubbed the overhaul a ""blueprint for success"".But investors did not respond positively, with Credit Suisse shares down more than 13% following the announcement.As part of the restructuring plan Credit Suisse aims to raise $4bn in new capital, $1.5bn of which will come from Saudi National Bank.It plans to spin off the bank's investment arm, relaunching the CS First Boston brand, and wind down some of its higher-risk businesses. Credit Suisse shares hit by financial health fearsHSBC climate change adverts banned by UK watchdogCap on bankers' bonuses will still be liftedThe workforce will fall from 52,000 now to 43,000 by the end of 2025, with 2,700 jobs going before the end of this year. Credit Suisse is based in Switzerland, but has a major hub in London and employs 5,500 people in the UK.That will help it shrink its overall cost base by SFr2.5bn or 15% by 2025, it said. It is also setting up a ""bad bank"" unit to house high-risk assets that it wants to wind down.This is the third attempt in recent years to turn around the embattled group after a series of scandals hit the bank, once considered a stalwart of Swiss respectability.In February 2020, its then chief executive Tidjane Thiam left after a scandal around covert surveillance operations. In March that year the Archegos investment fund imploded saddling Credit Suisse with huge losses and it was also dealt a blow by the collapse of the British finance company Greensill Capital.Last year, the bank's chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned after less than nine months for breaching Covid rules. Later the bank was fined for a corruption scandal involving Mozambique's tuna fishing industry. This year the bank was fined over a money-laundering scandal related to a Bulgarian drugs ring, replaced its chief executive, and last month found its shares under pressure from investors concerned about the firm's financial health. Its share price has halved since January.'Question marks'Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second largest bank, said the restructuring would create ""a simpler, more focused and more stable bank"".Ulrich Koerner, who took over as chief executive in July said the bank's performance this year had been affected by ""continued challenging market and macroeconomic conditions"".""This is a historic moment for Credit Suisse. We are radically restructuring the investment bank to help create a new bank that is simpler, more stable and with a more focused business model built around client needs,"" he said.JPMorgan analysts said that ""question marks remain"" over the restructuring, adding that the share sale to raise new money would weigh on the stock price.Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss investment managers Vontobel, said the plan was ""just the first step in a lengthy process to restore credibility and regain the trust"" of stakeholders.""Resolute execution and no further mis-steps will be key and it will take time until results will begin to show,"" he said.Related TopicsCompaniesBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storyCredit Suisse shares hit by financial health fears3 October 2022Credit Suisse guilty over money-laundering charges27 June 2022Greensill lender Credit Suisse axes bosses and pay6 April 2021Credit Suisse boss quits after spying scandal7 February 2020Credit Suisse denies wrongdoing after data leak20 February 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished49 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

The Swiss banking giant, one of the most venerable names in the industry, has been rocked by two high profile bankruptcies. On Thursday, Swiss regulators announced they were widening probes into Credit Suisse's activities.These relate to dealings with two firms, Archegos and Greensill.Credit Suisse suffered a multi-billion-dollar hit after Archegos, a US hedge fund, folded. The bank is also a creditor of failed financial firm Greensill, which hit the headlines over its role funding the UK's Liberty Steel and lobbying by former Prime Minister David Cameron.Greensill lender Credit Suisse axes bosses and payArchegos collapse costs Morgan Stanley $911mOn Thursday, Credit Suisse posted a 757m Swiss franc ($827m; £594m) loss for the first three months of the year, having previously warned that losses could reach SFr900m.It would have been the bank's best trading quarter for a decade, but Credit Suisse was forced to write off SFr4.4bn related to the Archegos collapse.""The loss we report this quarter, because of this [Archegos] matter, is unacceptable,"" the bank's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, said in statement.As part of measures to bolster its finances, Credit Suisse said it would raise SFr 1.7bn ($1.9bn; £1.5bn) from investors. The news sent the Credit Suisse share price 5% lower in early trading. The shares have sunk 30% since the start of March.The Swiss financial regulator Finma was already looking into Credit Suisse's links to Greensill, and on Thursday announced it would now look into its involvement with Archegos.Reputation damageIn London on Thursday, administrators overseeing Greensill's activities said that its Australian parent company had entered liquidation.The administrator will now wind down Greensill activities and attempt to sell off parts of the business to help repay creditors.Mr Gottstein has been grappling with limiting the damage to Credit Suisse's reputation and retaining both clients and staff. He is expected to be helped in those efforts soon by former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, who is widely reported to become Credit Suisse's next chairman.But analysts have said the crisis at Credit Suisse will cast a long shadow over the bank.

Swiss rules meant he should have quarantined for 10 days upon his arrival.Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year following a series of scandals at the bank, In February 2020, then-Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigned after it was revealed the bank had spied on senior employees. Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the spying operations.Credit Suisse has also been hit with huge losses in connection with the failed financial firm Greensill - which backed Liberty Steel - and Archegos, the US hedge fund which collapsed last year.Last year, in a report into its relationship with Archegos, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability."" There are two narratives emerging from Antonio Horta-Osorio's short-lived tenure at the top of one of Swiss banking giants.One is that he broke the rules, was investigated and, having been found in breach, was asked to step down.But allies of the former boss of Lloyds Banking Group insist that the board of Credit Suisse could have censured him rather than forced him out and suggest that the Swiss bank had not appreciated his efforts to reform an executive team and a culture that has been hit a series of scandals in recent years. Credit Suisse clients lost billions after the bank funnelled them into financial products designed by the collapsed Greensill Capital while the bank itself took a multi-billion hit from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos. The bank also found itself at the centre of an unusual spying scandal which saw the departure of chief executive Tidjane Thiam.Ironically, the man Credit Suisse brought in to bring an end to a string of negative headlines is the subject of them this morning. Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment firm United First Partners, said Credit Suisse ""has been in the 'damaged goods' section for a while now"".""While Horta-Osorio was responsible for the new strategy, his short tenure means that the revamp is likely to only be in the nascent stage. The irony of it is that Horta was hired to fix the reputational damage to Credit Suisse and revamp its risk taking culture in the bank.""In his statement, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank.""But George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: ""Only [nine] months in is not really time to achieve much. ""He was brought in to turn around the business - it is a bank that has been hit by scandal - and so it means that his reign has been cut short. ""Not everybody is above the law for Covid restrictions.""Mr Horta-Osorio was chief executive at Lloyds Banking Group for 10 years, the start of which was marked by a surprise two month leave of absence to deal with severe sleep deprivation. Later on, amid media reports of an extra-marital affair, Mr Horta-Osorio emailed Lloyds staff, saying: ""I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group's reputation.""I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me.""Speaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse said that the bank would give no further details on Mr Horta-Osorio's resignation other than those in its statement.They also said that there were no plans to release the findings of the investigation.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, ""You can't be at peak performance forever""Related TopicsCompaniesBankingCredit SuisseCoronavirus pandemicMore on this storyBanks fined over collusion in currency trading2 December 2021Ai Weiwei: Credit Suisse closed account over China8 September 2021Greensill lender suffers 'unacceptable' loss22 April 2021Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the bank had ""failed to properly manage the risk of financial crime"". Executive director of enforcement Mark Steward said: ""The FCA's fine reflects the impact of these tainted transactions which included a debt crisis and economic harm for the people of Mozambique.""The fine would have been higher if not for Credit Suisse agreeing to provide the debt write-off of $200m.""Mozambique's tuna corruption scandal puts justice on trialAccording to the FCA, a Mozambique government contractor secretly paid ""significant kickbacks, estimated at over $50m, to members of Credit Suisse's deal team"" between 2012 and 2016 in order to secure loans at more favourable rates.Two managing directors at the investment bank were among those to allegedly receive the bribes. Meanwhile, Mozambican officials received at least $137m in bribes during the same period, the FCA said.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Credit Suisse had ""deficient internal accounting controls, which failed to properly address significant and known risks concerning bribery"".The bank has agreed to pay the SEC nearly $100m, the regulator said.Former Credit Suisse investment bankers and their intermediaries have been indicted, the SEC said.The fine comes as 19 individuals - including the son of former President Armando Guebuza - have gone on trial in Mozambique charged with bribery, embezzlement and money laundering.

Credit Suisse told the BBC it did not comment on client relationships. The contemporary artist famously designed the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but ran into serious problems after he spoke out against the Chinese government. This saw him spend 81 days in prison in 2011. In the Artnet article Mr Ai wrote that in spring 2021 he had received a ""surprising notice"" from Credit Suisse. ""The bank informed me that it was terminating my account in Switzerland. They did this, they wrote, in accordance with a new policy of closing all accounts with people who have had criminal records. They believed (or pretended to believe?) that I had been convicted of a crime in China.""Just a bit of homework could have shown them that I was never formally charged, let alone convicted of a crime."" Balancing actWestern banks are finding themselves in a tricky position: balancing geopolitical issues with their desire to attract China's ever-growing ultra-wealthy as customers.  The Economist Intelligence Unit's Simon Baptist told the BBC the ""golden era"" was over: ""Businesses used to be able to easily exploit the big wealthy market of the US and the big and fast-growing one of China.  ""Now, both are actively pushing regulations incompatible with the other in an attempt to force companies to choose, as much as business wants to avoid it.""Mr Ai said he had faced similar actions from banks in Germany and Hong Kong: ""You know, these banks are very arrogant.""

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

But on Sunday, the Swiss bank said it strongly rejected the allegations and insinuations about its alleged business practices or lack of due diligence.""The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context"", it said.'Public pressure will cause politicians to act'The banker who can't stay out of the headlinesWorld leaders deny wrongdoing after Pandora leaksIn reports published by media organisations such as The Guardian and the New York Times, it has been claimed the bank opened or maintained accounts for high-risk clients, including criminals and individuals involved in human trafficking.Holding a Swiss account is not illegal and the leak also reportedly contained data of clients who had done nothing wrong. The data was shared with more than 40 media organisations around the world by non-profit journalism group, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.It includes bank accounts dating back decades. The majority were opened from 2000 onwards, although the bank's current operations are not included.Credit Suisse also said on Sunday that it had reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. ""Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015,"" it said, although it would not comment on specific clients mentioned.The bank added it was ""deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld"".""These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market-place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years,"" it said.'Shameful role'In a statement published by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the anonymous source explained their motivation for leaking the records more than a year ago.""I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral. The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders,"" they wrote.It is not known if the whistleblower is an individual or a group.They also acknowledged ""having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime"".Credit Suisse pointed out it had taken ""significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime"".It follows other scandals for the Swiss bank, including the departure of two of its top executives after allegedly breaking Covid regulations and spying on former staff.Related TopicsCompaniesBankingCredit SuisseMore on this storyThe banker who can't stay out of the headlines25 January 2022Banker who quit over Covid breach went to Euros final21 January 2022Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

Deep regretHe said: ""We deeply regret that - despite the industry-leading compliance measures we have put in place - before 2009, some Credit Suisse private bankers appear to have violated US law.""""The evidence showed that some Swiss-based private bankers went to great lengths to disguise their bad conduct from Credit Suisse executive management.""The report said that in 2006, Credit Suisse held 22,000 accounts from US customers worth 12bn Swiss francs ($13.5bn; £8.1bn).Mr Dougan disputed some of the findings of the report, saying the subcommittee wrongly assumed every US client account held in Switzerland was hidden from the US government.He said the bank was fighting lawsuits in Switzerland from clients trying to prevent it from giving information to the US authorities. ""These are not the actions of an institution flouting US law enforcement or hiding behind Swiss law,"" he said.Stalled effortCurrently, the US Justice Department (DOJ) is investigating 14 Swiss banks over tax evasion - five years after UBS admitted to helping US clients hide money.""It's five years later, and the sad truth is that the era of bank secrecy is not over,"" said Senator Carl Levin, a democrat from Michigan and chairman of the Senate committee that published the report.""We have great concern that the battle to collect those unpaid taxes on hidden offshore assets seems stalled.""During the Senate hearing, US politicians lashed out at Credit Suisse executives both over the bank's behaviour and over the Swiss government's perceived obstructions into helping US authorities identify Americans who are evading tax.""The whole idea that the Swiss government is cooperating with us is a joke,"" said Mr Levin.He also scolded the DOJ for having only identified 238 client names from Credit Suisse out of 20,000 accounts.""To collect those unpaid taxes and hold U.S. tax evaders accountable, the critical first step is to get their names,"" he said.According to the report, after Credit Suisse started phasing out its tax evasion practices, the number of Swiss accounts held by US clients at Credit Suisse fell by 85%.More on this storyCredit Suisse 'aided' US tax evaders26 February 2014Fannie Mae sues over Libor losses1 November 2013Related Internet LinksCredit SuisseThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

UBS ended up paying a $780m fine, but more importantly the new legislation put an end to Switzerland's famed banking secrecy.Earlier this year, US authorities said they were investigating the role of UK bank HSBC in helping Indian citizens living in the United States to evade taxes.More on this storyHSBC comes under US tax scrutiny8 April 2011UBS up as rich clients flock back26 April 2011Swiss banker tried over secrecy19 January 2011Swiss MPs back tax evasion deal15 June 2010Swiss set to share UBS tax data25 November 2009Related Internet LinksCredit SuisseUS Department of JusticeThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

""They subverted disclosure requirements, destroyed bank records, and concealed transactions involving undeclared accounts by limiting withdrawal amounts and using offshore credit and debit cards to repatriate funds.""He added that the tax evasion schemes went back decades, saying that in one case, the practice of using sham entities began more than 100 years ago.The US Department of Justice said Credit Suisse ""operated an illegal cross-border banking business"" that helped thousands of US customers conceal offshore assets and income from US tax authorities.However, according to US media reports, neither Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner nor chief executive Brady Dougan are expected to lose their jobs as a result of the agreement.Mr Dougan told investors on Tuesday he had not encountered pressure to step down.""My focus has been on resolving the issue and taking the business forward, so no, that's never been a consideration,"" he said. ""We're working very very hard to fix this business.""Credit Suisse will meet most of the cost of the fine by selling some of its risky assets, the bank's chief financial officer David Mathers said.Since 2011 US authorities have indicted eight Credit Suisse employees who helped clients evade taxes.Credit Suisse is not alone. US prosecutors are chasing more than a dozen other Swiss banks for allegedly helping wealthy Americans dodge US taxes, and at the press conference, they hinted that there would be more settlements to come.In 2009, another Swiss bank, UBS, settled similar charges with US regulators for $780m as well as an agreement in which the bank would give US authorities the names of its so-called ""secret"" account holders.Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

The FCA said that the probability of getting back a minimum return was between 40% and 50%, while the chance of a maximum return was ""close to 0%"".The product was typically sold to people with limited investment experience, the FCA said.""These promotions were a serious breach of the requirement to be clear, fair and not misleading,"" said Tracey McDermott, FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime.""CSI [Credit Suisse] and YBS knew that the chances of receiving the maximum return were close to zero but they nevertheless highlighted this as a key promotional feature of the product. This was unacceptable.""'Fallen short'The product was sold to 83,777 people, who had a total of £797m invested.Credit Suisse said: ""We accept the findings of the FCA's final notice.""We have taken this matter very seriously, have fully co-operated with the FCA's investigation and have agreed a comprehensive redress process under which affected retail customers will be eligible to claim compensation.""YBS said it accepted the FCA decision, and apologised to its customers.""On this occasion we have fallen short of our own high standards, and of putting our customers at the heart of everything we do.

 that net profit rose to 788m francs in the second quarter from 768m a year earlier.
        The Swiss central bank last month told Credit Suisse to raise its reserves because it was ""too big to fail"".A strong capital buffer would protect against losses rising from the eurozone crisis or the weak global economy.A failure by either Credit Suisse or rival UBS - which also received the recommendation from the Swiss National Bank - would threaten the entire Swiss financial system.Banks around the world are required to boost their capital ratio - a broader measure that includes debts that can be converted into equity - by January 2013 when so-called Basel III regulations will take effect. ""The capital measures that we announced today take any question of the strength of our capitalisation off the table,"" chief executive Brady Dougan said in a statement.It said the measures would increase its core capital ratio to 9.4% by the end of the year.Credit Suisse said 3.8bn francs of the reserves being raised will come via so-called contingent convertible bonds (""Coco bonds"") placed to investors from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Singapore.These are debts of the bank that would immediately convert into equity - shares in the bank - if the bank breaches the minimum common equity ratio required by regulators.In this way, the Coco bonds would automatically top-up the banks' capital buffer against losses and would count towards the banks' total capital ratiosCredit Suisse said it also raised its cost-saving target to 3bn francs after cutting 2bn francs in costs in the first half of this year.

It emerged that two former employees had been put under surveillance, although Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the operations. Mr Rohner said things ""became more difficult"" when a second case emerged.Speaking to Swiss radio, Mr Rohner said Mr Thiam's departure was to maintain the bank's credibility, and denied there was ill-feeling between the two.""At some point we realised that we couldn't get out of this situation unless we made a change and Tidjane Thiam understood that too,"" he said.Credit Suisse's board has unanimously backed Mr Rohner, despite high profile pledges of support for Mr Thiam from key investors. The surveillance scandal initially came to light in September when a probe found the bank's former chief operating officer, Pierre-Olivier Bouée, had hired private detectives to track its former head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan.Credit Suisse later admitted its former human resources head Peter Goerke had also been tailed, prompting an investigation by Swiss financial watchdog FINMA.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Relations between Mr Thiam and Mr Rohner were said to have become strainedThe bank's board unanimously accepted Mr Thiam's resignation.This week a number of shareholders in Credit Suisse, such as Harris Associates, had backed Mr Thiam to stay on as chief executive and for Mr Rohner to go.And on Wednesday, Mr Thiam posted a smiling photo of himself on Instagram with Credit Suisse's executive team.However, the bank's board has thrown its support behind Mr Rohner.Credit Suisse's lead independent director Severin Schwan said: ""After careful deliberations, the board has been unanimous in its actions, as well as in reaffirming its full support for the chairman to complete his term until April 2021.""Mr Rohner told Swiss broadcaster SRF on Friday: ""I have spoken with many [shareholders], also with the big ones.

It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place.""The spying scandal, which involved Iqbal Khan, Credit Suisse's former head of wealth management being chased through the streets of Zurich, rocked the rather staid world of Swiss banking, overshadowing Tidjane Thiam's attempts to overhaul the bank. Mr Thiam and Mr Khan had previously been close allies, with the wealth management business a cornerstone in the chief executive's turnaround plan. He pivoted the bank away from riskier trading activities, stabilising revenue.  The scandal, which emerged after Mr Khan defected to rival UBS, claimed the jobs of two senior Credit Suisse executives and resulted in a probe from the regulators - but Mr Thiam was cleared of involvement at the time. But as the accusations escalated, a showdown between Mr Thiam and the board ensued. Urs Rohner triumphed: the man responsible for appointing Mr Thiam also determined his departure. Tidjane Thiam has for many years been a high profile figure in the financial world, even resorting to Instagram to put his message out, and denies any wrongdoing   The bank's largest shareholders had publicly called for him to be retained; now the challenge for Credit Suisse is to persuade shareholders that his successor, bank veteran Thomas Gottstein, can continue to restore its fortunes. Mr Thiam has had an illustrious and varied career. The French Ivorian studied in France and worked in management consultancy before serving as Ivory Coast's Minister of Planning and Development, until a military coup led to him being placed under house arrest. He later became boss of financial services firms Aviva Europe and Prudential before joining Credit Suisse five years ago. Mr Thiam had attempted to overhaul the Swiss bank, including increased focus on Mr Khan's wealth management division.While he had initially praised and promoted Mr Khan, there were reports a personal animosity had developed. This intensified after Mr Khan redeveloped a property near Lake Zurich neighbouring that of his boss.Media reports suggested there was an altercation between Mr Khan and Mr Thiam's girlfriend at a cocktail party held by the chief executive at his home, over trees planted on Mr Thiam's property.Shortly after that Mr Khan announced his departure from Credit Suisse.It later emerged private detectives were hired to track him due to fears he might poach clients when he started work at UBS.Mr Khan, after noticing he was being tailed, had confronted the person observing him.More on this storySpying scandal forces out Credit Suisse executive1 October 2019Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

It is thought that Archegos made some large investments in certain companies that started to go wrong, and its backers then insisted it raise money in a hurry, in what is known as a margin call, prompting some unusually large share sales.A margin call is when a bank asks a client to put up more funds if a trade partly funded with borrowed money has dropped steeply. If they can't afford to do that, the lender will sell the shares to try to recover what it is owed.SpreeCompanies caught up in the selling spree include big names such as ViacomCBS, Discovery, Tencent, Baidu, and UK online retailer Farfetch.  Investors in both banks have been rattled, Credit Suisse shares are down 14% and Nomura's closed down 16% on the Japanese stock market. Fears over who else might be affected by the matter has prompted falls in the shares of other banks, including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, although by far smaller amounts.Credit Suisse's fortunes are already facing a hit from its lending to Greensill Capital, the finance firm whose collapse has put at risk the future of the UK's Liberty Steel.'Material' lossIn a statement issued on Monday, Credit Suisse said: ""A significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. ""Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions.""While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results.""Neither named Archegos Capital Management, which, although not a household name, is a big player in US markets. It is the family investment firm of Bill Hwang, who was banned in 2014 from trading in Hong Kong, and in 2012 settled insider trading charges in the US.The surprise default of a US hedge fund will send shivers through world stock markets. Traders will inevitably recall the demise two decades ago of Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that was one of the darlings of Wall Street only to collapse in the late 1990s. So big and complicated was its trading book that a bailout had to be organised among the US financial industry's biggest players, but before they stepped in there was a period of horrible uncertainty over whether the fund's demise might cause a large market crash.At first sight Archegos does not look to be another LTCM - it is much smaller, and it appears to have been managing the money only of its founder and traders rather than for external investors. But one of the lessons of the 2008 crash is that the financial world is deeply interconnected, and it is difficult to gauge exactly what risks and trading positions individual hedge funds have built up. One of the curiosities of Archegos's default is that it was set up by Bill Hwang, a trader with a chequered past - he was banned from the Hong Kong market in 2014. Why banks like Credit Suisse and Nomura chose to have substantial business with his firm will be a subject of great interest to both institutions' senior management and shareholders.Related TopicsCompaniesBankingCredit SuisseTop StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

Swiss authorities see CoCos as way to avoid future government bail-outs of financial institutions.The bonds convert into shares under certain conditions, such as if a bank's capital ratio falls below a certain point.This would mean investors would share in the pain if a bank gets into trouble in the future, as their CoCo bonds would be transformed into bank equity.

The bank stressed its commitment to diversity, saying it had put in place ""a number of initiatives to improve ethnic diversity across the bank"".It said it had signed up to the UK's Business in the Community Race at Work Charter, which requires firms to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards racial harassment or bullying, and in the US it has a programme to hire, retain and advance black talent.""Credit Suisse is strongly committed to equality, diversity and supporting all our employees,"" the investment bank said.""As a company, we are proud to be a geographically and culturally diverse group, and we strive to further strengthen this culture, which supports all our colleagues.""The Guardian reported that a friend of Mr Thiam said the former executive had not received a personal apology. Mr Thiam could not be reached for comment.Illustrious careerMr Thiam, who ran Credit Suisse between 2015 and February this year, has had an illustrious and varied career. The French Ivorian studied in France and worked in management consultancy before serving as Ivory Coast's Minister of Planning and Development, until a military coup led to him being placed under house arrest.He later became boss of financial services firms Aviva Europe and Prudential before joining Credit Suisse five years ago. In doing so he became the only black executive at the top of a major global bank. Mr Thiam, who also holds French citizenship, has appeared on Desert Island Discs as the first ever black chief executive of a top 100 UK company.He is on record saying he was heavily courted for his role at Credit Suisse and had strong backing from Mr Rohner. That backing was withdrawn along with that of the rest of the board after the spying scandal, although some leading shareholders retained their support.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

However, they expose investors to the risk that they could lose all or part of the sum invested.Credit Suisse customers invested more than £1bn in these products over the three years in question, but there were losses estimated at £192m during this period.The bank, which operates a private bank for wealthy investors, advised 623 customers to invest in Scarps over the period.The FSA said that not enough attention was paid by the bank to assessing customers' attitudes to risk.  It said the fine was reduced from £8.5m owing to a settlement at an early stage in its investigations.""We have seen all too frequently the consequences of financial services firms failing to implement proper systems and controls to ensure their customers invest in suitable products,"" said Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA.  ""A proper assessment of customers' individual needs and circumstances is even more critical where firms are selling complex products like Scarps.""Issues at Credit Suisse included:Failing to properly assess customers' attitudes to riskNot taking reasonable care to check whether Scarps were suitable for individual investorsFailing to monitor staff to ensure they took reasonable care when giving adviceIn a statement, Credit Suisse said it ""deeply regretted"" the failings of systems and controls. ""We have made significant improvements to our processes and controls since 2009 and we are confident that we currently comply with our regulatory obligations,"" it said.

His bail was set at £150,000 and he will be required to wear an electronic tagging device.Credit Suisse said Mr Serageldin and his two colleagues were dismissed in 2008.In addition to the criminal charges, Mr Serageldin and his colleagues, David Higgs and Salmaan Siddiqui, were the subject of civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).A fourth man, Faisal Siddiqui, was also charged by the SEC, but did not receive criminal charges.The SEC filing alleged that the ""fraudulent scheme was initiated by Kareem Serageldin"".US trading desks are required to price the bonds they hold on a daily basis to record their fair value.The traders involved specialised in bonds based on US mortgages.The SEC said that when the value of those bonds began to decline in late 2007, they had ""abandoned their obligation to accurately record the fair value of their bonds and instead began to price the bonds in a way that allowed them to achieve their goal of showing consistently profitable trading"".When Credit Suisse discovered the wrongly-priced bonds, it reported that the value of them had been overstated by $540m (£333m).Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

Mortgage-backed securities are financial products backed by mortgages, many of which in the financial crisis of 2008 were proved to be worthless.  Credit Suisse's private banking and wealth management division put aside 175m francs to fight a U.S. investigation into hidden offshore accounts in Switzerland.In both cases the bank said it was ""working towards a resolution"" with US authorities but did not give a time-frame of when that resolution might be reached.  Western European clients have been pulling cash funds out of Credit Suisse but the bank said it had attracted some 1.7bn francs in new funds from wealthy clients in emerging markets.The bank is restructuring its businesses to reduce its reliance on interest rate trading in the investment bank.

The report alleges bankers helped clients create offshore shell entities and design transactions to avoid arousing suspicion.Credit Suisse declined to comment.""From at least 2001 to 2008, Credit Suisse employed banking practices that facilitated tax evasion by US customers,"" the report by a US congressional committee said.It said the practices included ""opening undeclared Swiss accounts"" or accounts to ""mask their US ownership"", as well as sending Swiss bankers to the US to recruit new customers and ""service existing Swiss accounts without creating paper trails"".US prosecutors are chasing 14 Swiss banks for allegedly helping wealthy Americans dodge US taxes.

The report has also published details of the way, it alleges, the bank worked to keep the accounts concealed from the US authorities. It said some bankers even applied for US visa waivers, claiming they planned to visit the country for ""tourism"" instead of ""business"" purposes. The report listed one incident where a client was handed bank statements hidden in a Sports Illustrated magazine.It said the bank also used sponsored events, including the annual ""Swiss Ball"" in New York and golf tournaments in Florida, to recruit more customers. Strict actionThe committee has called upon US regulators to take strict action against banks that help US customers avoid taxes.  ""For too long, international financial institutions like Credit Suisse have profited from their offshore tax haven schemes while depriving the US economy of billions of dollars in tax revenues by facilitating US tax evasion,"" said Senator John McCain, a member of the subcommittee. ""As federal regulators begin to crack down on these banks' illicit practices, it is imperative that they use every legal tool at their disposal to hold these banks fully accountable for wilfully deceiving the US government and seek penalties that will deter similar misconduct in the future.""The US Justice Department issued a statement saying it was investigating various Swiss banks over the issue.""We won't hesitate to indict if and when circumstances merit,"" it said.More on this storyTax evaders targeted in ad campaign23 February 2014Legal costs hit Credit Suisse profit6 February 2014Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Khan left Credit Suisse earlier this yearThe scandal surfaced in September when it transpired that the bank had hired corporate intelligence firm Investigo to track Mr Khan, due to fears he might poach clients when he started work at UBS this week.Mr Khan, after noticing he was being tailed, confronted the person observing him. His version of the altercation that ensued differs markedly from the report from Investigo and the incident is under criminal investigation.'Severe reputational damage'Questions were raised over who within Credit Suisse instigated the operation to have Mr Khan followed, and who was aware of it.As a result Credit Suisse hired law firm Homburger to examine the chain of responsibility and whether Mr Khan had violated the terms of his contract.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mr Thiam joined Credit Suisse as chief executive in 2015 after a career at PrudentialThe personal relationship between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan was not part of the investigation, Credit Suisse said.""The Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to September 18, 2019, after the observation had been aborted,"" the bank said.Credit Suisse said that the decision to observe Mr Khan was ""wrong and disproportionate and has resulted in severe reputational damage to the bank"".The Homburger report said neither its own investigations nor those of intelligence firm Investigo found evidence that Mr Khan had attempted to poach employees or customers away from Credit Suisse.More on this storyGoldman bosses charged in Malaysia bond scandal9 August 2019Mozambique files case against Credit Suisse28 February 2019Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

Prudential's share price was 2.3% lower at 1625p after news of Mr Thiam's departure was confirmed. Credit Suisse meanwhile saw its shares rise 7% in Frankfurt to €23.17.Mr Thiam's decision to quit will be seen as a loss for Prudential, which has seen its share price flourish during his time at the helm.In the early days of Mr Thiam's tenure, there was widespread speculation over whether he would remain boss after Prudential failed to buy Asian business AIA, costing the insurer £377m.Mr Thiam publicly apologised for the high-profile failure, but since then has been credited for driving the group's rapid expansion.Prudential said on Tuesday it was increasing its full year dividend by 10% to 36.93p, reflecting the group's strong financial performance in the year.  Analysis: Business editor, Kamal AhmedTidjane Thiam was that rare thing among chief executives of large, global corporates - someone who oversaw a shambolic attempt at executing a multi-billion pound deal, and survived.And - if you look at Prudential's performance since then - many now argue that it was quite right that he did so.The deal in question was the £21bn bid to take over AIA, the Asian insurance giant.Such was Mr Thiam's lack of experience in the world of acquisitions (he had only taken over as CEO a year earlier) the whole process was dogged by mistakes.The Financial Services Authority fined Prudential £30m for failing to keep the regulator properly informed.What Mr Thiam's departure proves, five years later, is that if investors have patience, a chief executive with the right strategy (strong expansion in Asia) can survive a tricky start.Since 2010, Prudential's share price has risen by 211%.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Credit Suisse boss Brady Dougan will stand down in JunePrudential also warned it faced ""a considerable period of change in 2015,"" which had already seen global economic volatility, political upheaval and unexpected shifts in central bank positioning"". The company added: ""The persistently low level of interest rates is a challenge for insurance companies.""The insurer said operating pre-tax profit for the year was 14% higher to £3.2bn based on the performance of its longer term investments. Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner said Mr Thiam was ""a strong and distinguished leader with an impressive track record in the global financial services industry"".He added: ""His extensive international experience, including in wealth and asset management and in the successful development of new markets, provides a firm foundation for leading Credit Suisse.""Mr Thiam said he would presenting the Pru's first quarter results in May and attending his final AGM as chief executive shortly afterwards.More on this storyUS and Asia lift Prudential profits12 August 2014Credit Suisse posts quarterly loss22 July 2014Related Internet LinksCredit SuissePrudentialThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. 

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sourcesAnalysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trendsAsk the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience responseExplainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the newsOpinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and dataReview - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion 

Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language.  We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.

For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods.

Also named in the filing are three former Credit Suisse bankers, who have already been indicted in the US. Credit Suisse declined to comment.The court records said the case related to ""commercial contracts"", but gave no further details.Mozambique's economy has been in crisis since 2016, when it emerged the country had more than $2bn of undisclosed state debts.Bankers arrested over '$2bn fraud scheme' The loans, taken out between 2013 and 2016, were marketed as investments in schemes including maritime security projects and a state tuna fishery. But a proportion of the money has not been accounted for and the allegations made in the US indictment include accusations of kickbacks and fraud.Manuel Chang, the former Mozambique finance minister who signed off on the loans, has been detained in South Africa since December on charges related to the loans scandal. He denies any wrongdoing.The court documents filed in London also mention Surjan Singh, Andrew Pearse and Detelina Subeva, former employees of Credit Suisse who are waiting to hear whether they will be extradited to face charges in the US.

Jim Amine, global head of investment banking, said in a memo that staff in the Americas should avoid work between 6pm on Fridays and 10am on Sundays. However, the investment bank said Sunday working was allowed after 10am.It is part of a series of changes to improve job quality for junior bankers, and comes amid worries about a long-hours culture in the financial sector. A Credit Suisse spokesperson told the BBC that other steps include the creation of a fast track promotion programme for top performers, and a new mentoring scheme. Stress and long hours in the workplace, especially within the banking sector, have been a frequent topic of discussion. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Junior bankers are being encouraged to leave before midnight on SundaysRecently, the former boss of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) Sir Hector Sants, Barclays' head of compliance, announced his departure due to stress and exhaustion. Last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch launched a review of working conditions for junior staff after the death of an intern employed at its London offices.The Credit Suisse memo adds that if a junior banker is ""in the office past midnight"" on Sunday, they should email their bosses with the reason. Saturday work would take place, however, if the staff were involved in a ""live trade"". But all members of the team would have to attend.The memo says, however, that junior bankers are expected to reply to emails in a ""timely manner"" throughout the weekend.More on this storyCity intern death prompts review23 August 2013Barclays' Sants resigns over stress13 November 2013Stress test: Are you fit for work?7 January 2014Amazon workers face ‘illness risk’25 November 2013City intern death sparks debate21 August 2013Top StoriesUK-Israeli mother wounded in West Bank attack diesPublished50 minutes agoLive. Five dead in shooting at Kentucky bankPublished2 hours agoNHS braces for most disruptive walkout yetPublished23 minutes agoFeaturesWhat does the huge leak of Ukraine war documents tell us?We were born on the day the peace deal was signed.
